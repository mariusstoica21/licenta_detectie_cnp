# CNP Detection - Delphi, Winium, Python and VHDL

The system receives an image of the identity card, localizes the 13 digits of the CNP (unique string of 13 digits), it
classifies each digit, using a convolutional neural network. The digits are detected, and the results of the convolutions
applied on them are send to the FPGA board, using UART transmission protocol. The artificial neural network implemented 
on the FPGA gets the intermediate results and the model (weights and biases) of the neural network, and classifies each 
digit.

The requests of the system include:
  - Creating a program that localizes the digits from CNP.
  - Creating a program that gets every digit of the 13 digits and classifies each one of them, using a convolutional
neural network.
  - Creating a desktop application, with a user-friendly graphic user interface, intuitive and fast, with a commercial look.
  - Creating a database in order to save the users of the app and data about them, (hashed passwords), the original images 
 and the processed images, and a event history of the app, for each user.
  - Creating an artificial neural network on the FPGA board, in order to classify those 13 digits of the CNP.
  - Creating a program that automatizes the desktop app, with the purpose of transmitting the input of the artificial neural
network and the model to the FPGA board.

## Tutorial

### Delphi

Default form of the app. The form allows the user to log in, in order to have access to the apps functionalities. The user has to have an account and a password. The user has the option to sign up, by pressing "Don't you have an account? Sign up here". The entered password is hashed. The value of the hash is compared to the value of the hash in the database. If there is a match, the user is redirected to the menu of the app.

<p align="center">

  >
</p>

The sign up form has the role to sign up the users that do not have an account in the database. The users have the option to choose their profile image, by pressing the 'Choose image' button. The profile image will be loaded from the file system. Users shall write the firstname, lastname, username and password. The password will be hashed and saved in the database.

<p align="center">

  >
</p>

'Load image' has the role to load an image with the identity card, and to pass it to the preprocessing stage. The user will choose the image by pressing the 'Choose image' button. The image can be selected from the file system, and once selected, it will appear in the 'Original image' area. By pressing the 'Send image' button, the original image will be send to the processing stage. After aprox. 15 seconds, the processed image with the CNP digits detected will be shown in the 'Processed image' area. Meanwhile, the input of the neural network and the model (weights and biases) will be send to the FPGA board, in order to classify the digits. The 'Remove images' button will delete both the original and processed images, giving the user the opportunity for a new process of detection.

<p align="center">
  <img

</p>

After the processing stage, the processed image is displayed. Above the original CNP, a string of digits is shown, being the digits that the OCR predicted. In the given case, OCR has predicted well all the digits.

<p align="center">

  >
</p>

'Results' will display the images that correspond to the detected digits in CNP. Results appear only if the an image of identity card was loaded and send to processing. Under 'Images', the images of the digits are shown. Under 'Expected results', the expected results are shown, either with a green border for those who were classified correctly, or a red border otherwise.

<p align="center">

  >
</p>

'Library' displays the saved images from the database, both original and processed. There are two tables, one with the original images, and another one with the processed images. The user may choose the image he/she wants to see, by clicking the desired filename. In case the size of the image shown is too small, the user can 'Open Image' and maximize it.

### VHDL

In the image below, the first 4 digits out of the 13 of the CNP are shown. The values of the CNP are shifted with 1 position to the left, once a second, so that all the digits will be displayed. The leds show the results of the outputs for every digit, in fixed point representation. Every digit has 10 possible outputs. Totally, there are 130 outputs, that can be shown by pressing one of the buttons of the FPGA board.

### Artificial Neural Network

Confusion matrix outputs how many times the values were correctly predicted. For example, 0 was correctly predicted 962 times. The value 1 was correctly predicted 1116 times. It can be seen that the values on the diagonal are the greatest, since the digits were most of the time predicted correctly, the neural network having an accuracy of 92%. The confusion matrix also displays the digits with problems. For example, digit 4 was 49 times predicted as being 9.

### Convolutional Neural Network

The confusion matrix of the convolutional neural network has better results than the previous confusion matrix. The accuracy has grown from 92% to 98% for the testing dataset. For example, value 0 was predicted 976 times correctly using the CNN, as oposed to 962 with the ANN. The values on the diagonal are greater.

### Optical character recognition

The preprocessing stage before giving the original image as an input for OCR algorithm with Tesseract. Original image was converted into grayscale image, than a tresholded image, and finally the input image after the canny edge detection was applied.
